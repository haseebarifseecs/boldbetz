# Map Renderer based on Leaflet built on React.js
## _Using GeoJSON Data Format_

## Approach

- App was created using  "```npx create-react-app [your-app-name-here]```"
- In built ```fetch``` API was used to read and parse Local Json Data.
- ```Leaflet.js``` was selected and used to render Map based on Json Data.
- ```Polyline``` component is used to draw and render "line segment" connecting two coordinates.

## Installation
